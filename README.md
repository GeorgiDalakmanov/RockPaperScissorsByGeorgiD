Rock - Paper - Scissors is a simple two player game, where you and your opponent (the computer) simultaneously choose one of the following three options: "rock", "paper" or "scissors". The rules are as follows:

•	Rock beats scissors (the scissors get broken by the rock)

•	Scissors beats paper (the paper get cut by the scissors)

•	Paper beats rock (the paper covers the rock)

## The winner is the player whose choice beats the choice of his opponent. If both players choose the same option (e.g. "paper"), the game outcome is "draw".
